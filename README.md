#Quake from Scratch

###In an effort to learn more about the C language and video game programming, this is an attempt to rebuild the hit PC game *Quake* from scratch, with the help of [Philip Buuck](http://philipbuuck.com/)'s [Handmade Quake series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKDuv-qJpTbCsXHsxcoSSsMarnfyNhHF) on YouTube.

#### Already done:
* Set up the  main function, and create data structures and loops to properly parse the command line
* Re-write strcmp() and atoi() to be more efficient and with more features than the C Standard Library versions.
* Add initial headers and additional STL
* Utilize Windows' `WinMain` entry point to create a re-sizable window
* Create game loop
* Re-optimize time-stepping to account for modern processors

#### To do:
* Everything else
